# Productivity
A collection of python scripts I use to help me stay focused and organized.
Inspired partly by https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html

This was my first attempt at a big programming project. The code is terrible, and will hopefully serve as a record of my progress in self-directed learning.

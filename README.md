# Productivity
A collection of python scripts I use to help me stay focused and organized.

### lifecal.py
	
Calculates the number of completed days, weeks, and percentage of life until 90. For perspective. Inspired by https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html

### planner.py

Creates directories and files for daily, weekly, and monthly plans, journals, and time logs.

### tracker.py

Time tracker. Records time spent on tasks in the daily log files created by planner. You can't improve what you can't measure.

### aggregate.py

Aggregates the entries in daily logs into the weekly log for a given week.
